title: Creating themes
--
A theme is just an extension.

- Make an extension that has a `mytheme/views/` folder
- Make up a `mytheme/views/layout.haml`
- Override the look of a page in `mytheme/views/base/default.haml`
- Put public stuff (images et al) in `mytheme/public/`
- Put CSS files in `mytheme/views/css/`
